And of course, all PHP scripts take advantage of PHP op-code caches such as APC.</p>"},{"location":"features/#template-inheritance","title":"Template Inheritance","text":"<p>Template inheritance was introduced in Smarty 3. Before template inheritance, we managed our templates in pieces such as header and footer templates. This organization lends itself to many problems that require some hoop-jumping, such as managing content within the header/footer on a per-page basis. With template inheritance, instead of including other templates we maintain our templates as single pages. We can then manipulate blocks of content within by inheriting them. This makes templates intuitive, efficient and easy to manage. See Template Inheritance for more info.</p>"},{"location":"features/#why-not-use-xmlxslt-syntax","title":"Why not use XML/XSLT syntax?","text":"<p>There are a couple of good reasons.

PHP syntax works well for application code, but quickly degenerates     when mixed with HTML. Smarty\\'s simple {tag} syntax is designed     specifically to express presentation.

The issue isn't their ability to learn PHP, it is about the consequences of mixing PHP with HTML. If designers use PHP, it is too easy to add code into templates that doesn't belong there (you just handed them a swiss-army knife when they just needed a knife.) You can teach them the rules of application design, but this is probably something they don't really need to learn (now they are developers!) The PHP manual is also an overwhelming pile of information to sift through. It is like handing the owner of a car the factory assembly manual when all they need is the owners manual. Smarty gives web designers exactly the tools they need, and gives developers fine-grained control over those tools.

One example is template colors. Normally if you wanted to change the color scheme of an application, you would have to go through each and every template file and change the colors.

You can use either single or double quotes. If you have a value that spans more than one line, enclose the entire value with triple quotes (\"\"\"). You can put comments into config files by any syntax that is not a valid config file syntax. We recommend using a <code>#</code> (hash) at the beginning of the line.</p> <p>The example config file above has two sections. Section names are enclosed in [brackets]. Section names can be arbitrary strings not containing <code>[</code> or <code>]</code> symbols. The four variables at the top are global variables, or variables not within a section. These variables are always loaded from the config file. If a particular section is loaded, then the global variables and the variables from that section are also loaded. If a variable exists both as a global and in a section, the section variable is used. If you name two variables the same within a section, the last one will be used unless <code>$config_overwrite</code> is disabled.</p> <p>Config files are loaded into templates with the built-in template function <code>{config_load}</code> or the API <code>configLoad()</code> function.</p> <p>You can hide variables or entire sections by prepending the variable name or section name with a period(.) eg <code>[.hidden]</code>. This is useful if your application reads the config files and gets sensitive data from them that the template engine does not need. If you have third parties doing template editing, you can be certain that they cannot read sensitive data from the config file by loading it into the template.</p> <p>Config files (or resources) are loaded by the same resource facilities as templates.
