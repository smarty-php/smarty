There are some bugs in older versions of PHP that cause problems with Smarty.
preg_replace() had a parameter added in 4.0.2 that is needed for Smarty.
preg_grep() previous to 4.0.4 has a bug which Smarty has a built-in workaround
for. PHP 4.0.4 has a bug with user callbacks which would cause this syntax in
Smarty to crash PHP: {$varname|@modname} Use PHP 4.0.4pl1 to fix this, or avoid
using the "@" with modifiers. if you are passing variables to {include}
statements, you will need PHP 4.0.4 or later, which requires the use of
get_defined_vars() function. Some versions of Windows 2k have a problem with
flock(). Comment out the flock() command in _write_file to get around this.

To be absolutely safe, use 4.0.4pl or later with Smarty.

Smarty versions previous to 2.0 require the PEAR libraries. Be sure to include
the path to the PEAR libraries in your php include_path. Config_file.class.php
uses the PEAR library for its error handling routines. PEAR comes with the PHP
distribution. Unix users check /usr/local/lib/php, windows users check
C:/php/pear.
