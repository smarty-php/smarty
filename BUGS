There are no known bugs with Smarty, although there are some bugs in PHP that
cause problems with Smarty. preg_replace() had a parameter added in 4.0.2 that
is needed for Smarty. preg_grep() previous to 4.0.4 has a bug which Smarty has
a built-in workaround for. PHP 4.0.4 has a bug with user callbacks which would
cause this syntax in Smarty to crash PHP: {$varname|@modname} Use PHP 4.0.4pl1
to fix this, or avoid using the "@" with modifiers. To be absolutely safe, use
4.0.4pl or later with Smarty.

Also be sure to include the path to the PEAR libraries in your php
include_path. Config_file.class.php uses the PEAR library for its error
handling routines. PEAR comes with the PHP distribution. Unix users check
/usr/local/lib/php, windows users check C:/php/pear.
