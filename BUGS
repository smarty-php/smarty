There are no known bugs with Smarty, although there are some bugs in PHP that
cause problems with Smarty. preg_replace() had a parameter added in 4.0.2 that
is needed for Smarty. preg_grep() previous to 4.0.4 has a bug which Smarty has
a built-in workaround for. PHP 4.0.4 has a bug with user callbacks which would
cause this syntax in Smarty to crash PHP: {$varname|@modname} Use PHP 4.0.4pl1
to fix this, or avoid using the "@" with modifiers. if you are passing variables
to {include} statements, you will need PHP 4.0.4 or later, which requires the
use of get_defined_vars() function. Some versions of Windows 2k have a problem
with flock(). Comment out the flock() command in _write_file to get around this.

To be absolutely safe, use 4.0.4pl or later with Smarty.
