BUILDING THE MANUAL IN WINDOWS HELP FILE (.CHM) FORMAT

Note: Where 'lang' is mentioned in this doc, it is the actual
language code (e.g. en) of the manual you are compiling,
not the 'lang' word itself!

With the herein described tools you're able to build the .chm manual
with two options:

  a) Simply build the traditional html manual
  b) Make a fancy version of the html manual and build it

=======================================================================
WHAT YOU NEED

* Microsoft(r) HTML Help Workshop. 
  You can download it freely at:
  http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/htmlhelp/html/vsconhh1start.asp
  You need the complete workshop package install (about 4 Megs).
  Of course you need Microsoft(r) Windows to run that software :)

* The html manual (build with 'make')
     
The .chm manual generator files (from cvs.php.net):

  make_chm.bat - The only file you need to run yourself.
  make_chm.php - Auto toc generator.
  
  To make the fancy manual, additional files are needed:

  make_chm_fancy.php       - Converts the normal html files to fancy
                             (good looking) pages
  make_chm_index_lang.html - Fancy index. (you find it in phpdoc/lang
                             dir, if it exists for that language). 
  make_chm_spc.gif         - GIF file needed by the fancy pages.
  make_chm_style.css       - This adds some good style to html files.

=======================================================================
INSTALLATION

Install Microsoft(r) HTML Help Workshop.

Put the above listed make_chm_* files to one directory.

Open make_chm.bat in a text editor and set the appropriate
environment variables. You need to
    
  - set PHP_PATH to the full path of the CGI php.exe on
    your machine (including php.exe).
  - set PHP_HELP_COMPILER to the full path of hhc.exe on
    your machine (including hhc.exe).
  - set PHP_HELP_COMPILE_LANG to the language code of the
    actual manual (use the code from cvs.php.net, eg. hu)
  - set PHP_HELP_COMPILE_DIR to the directory of the
    html manual (eg. ..\html when you build it like mentioned in the howto)
  - set PHP_HELP_COMPILE_INDEX to the index filename in
    the directory you set above. This used to be manual.html
    for a long time, but it seems it is now index.html.

  The following variable is only needed for the fancy manual:
  
  - set PHP_HELP_COMPILE_FANCYDIR to the directory name where 
    the fancy pages will go. 
    You can decide not to sacrifice any more space for the fancy dir 
    (it takes ~25% more space than the normal html-manual), and set 
    this variable to the same as PHP_HELP_COMPILE_DIR. Then your old 
    HTML files will be rewritten to be fancy ones.

=======================================================================
BUILDING THE MANUAL:

Put the html manual (~2100 files) under the subdir specified above in 
PHP_HELP_COMPILE_DIR (eg. html).

To compile the NORMAL manual, use the 'normal' command line option:

  make_chm normal

To compile the FANCY manual, just run:

  make_chm

After this process, you will have smarty_manual_lang.chm...
  
=======================================================================
The fancy design improvemenets and the .css file is based on
the newsite design(TM) work of Colin Viebrock [colin@easyDNS.com] :)
