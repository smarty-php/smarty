    <title>Cache Groups</title>
     <para>
      You can do more elaborate grouping by setting up cache_id groups. This is
      accomplished by separating each sub-group with a vertical bar "|" in the
      cache_id value. You can have as many sub-groups as you like.
     </para>
     <para>
      You can think of cache groups like a directory heirarchy. For instance, a
      cache group of "a|b|c" could be thought of as the directory structure
      "/a/b/c/". clear_cache(null,"a|b|c") would be like removing the files
      "/a/b/c/*". clear_cache(null,"a|b") would be like removing the files
      "/a/b/*". If you specify a compile_id such as
      clear_cache(null,"a|b","foo") it is treated as an appended cache group
      "/a/b/c/foo/". If you specify a template name such as
      clear_cache("foo.tpl","a|b|c") then Smarty will attempt to remove
      "/a/b/c/foo.tpl". You CANNOT remove a specified template name under
      multiple cache groups such as "/a/b/*/foo.tpl", the cache grouping works
      left-to-right ONLY. You will need to group your templates under a single
      cache group heirarchy to be able to clear them as a group.
     </para>
     <para>
      Cache grouping should not be confused with your template directory
      heirarchy, the cache grouping has no knowledge of how your templates are
      structured. So for example, if you have a template structure like
      "themes/blue/index.tpl" and you want to be able to clear all the cache
      files for the "blue" theme, you will need to create a cache group
      structure that mimics your template file structure, such as
      display("themes/blue/index.tpl","themes|blue"), then clear them with
      clear_cache(null,"themes|blue").
