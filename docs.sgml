	<title>Overview</title>
		<para>
		It is undoubtedly one of the most asked questions on the PHP mailing
		lists: how do I make my PHP scripts independent of the layout? While
		PHP is billed as "HTML embedded scripting language", after writing a
		couple of projects that mixed PHP and HTML freely one comes up with the
		idea that separation of form and content is a Good Thing [TM]. In
		addition, in many companies the roles of layout designer and programmer
		are separate. Consequently, the search for a templating solution
		ensues.
		</para>
		<para>
		In our company for example, the development of an application goes on
		as follows: After the requirements docs are done, the interface
		designer makes mockups of the interface and gives them to the
		programmer. The programmer implements business logic in PHP and uses
		interface mockups to create skeleton templates. The project is then
		handed off to the HTML designer/web page layout person who brings the
		templates up to their full glory. The project may go back and forth
		between programming/HTML a couple of times. Thus, it's important to
		have good template support because programmers don't want anything to
		do with HTML and don't want HTML designers mucking around with PHP
		code. Designers need support for config files, dynamic blocks and other
		stuff, but they don't want to have to deal with intricacies of the PHP
		programming language.
		</para>
		<para>
		Looking at many templating solutions available for PHP today, most of
		them provide a rudimentary way of substituting variables into templates
		and do a limited form of dynamic block functionality. But our needs
		required a bit more than that. We didn't want programmers to be dealing
		with HTML layout at ALL, but this was almost inevitable. For instance,
		if a designer wanted background colors to alternate on dynamic blocks,
		this had to be worked out with the programmer in advance. We also
		needed designers to be able to use their own configuration files, and
		pull variables from them into the templates. The list goes on.
		</para>
		<para>
		We started out writing out a spec for a template engine about a year
		ago.  After finishing the spec, we began to work on a template engine
		written in C that would hopefully be accepted for inclusion with PHP.
		Not only did we run into many complicated technical barriers, but there
		was also much heated debate about exactly what a template engine should
		and should not do. From this experience, we decided that the template
		engine should be written in PHP as a class, for anyone to use as they
		see fit. So we wrote an engine that did just that and
		<emphasis>SmartTemplate</emphasis> came into existence (note: this
		class was never submitted to the public). It was a class that did
		almost everything we wanted: regular variable substitution, supported
		including other templates, integration with config files, embedding PHP
		code, limited 'if' statement functionality and much more robust dynamic
		blocks which could be multiply nested. It did all this with regular
		expressions and the code turned out to be rather, shall we say,
		impenetrable. It was also noticably slow in large applications from all
		the parsing and regular expression work it had to do on each
		invocation. The biggest problem from a programmer's point of view was
		all the necessary work in the PHP script to setup and process templates
		and dynamic blocks. How do we make this easier?
		</para>
		<para>
		Then came the vision of what ultimately became Smarty. We know how fast
		PHP code is without the overhead of template parsing. We also know how
		meticulous and overbearing the PHP language may look to the average
		designer, and this could be masked with a much simpler templating
		syntax. So what if we combined the two strengths? Thus, Smarty was
		born...
		</para>
	<sect1>
        <title>What is Smarty?</title>
		<para>
		Smarty is a template engine for PHP. One of the unique aspects about
		Smarty that sets it apart from other templating solutions is that it
		compiles the templates into native PHP scripts upon the first
		invocation. After that, it merely executes the compiled PHP scripts.
		Therefore, there is no costly template file parsing for each request.

		<title>How Smarty works</title>
		<sect2><title>Compiling</title>
			<para>
			Smarty compiles the templates into native PHP code on-the-fly. The actual
			PHP scripts that are generated are created implicitly, so theoretically you
			should never have to worry about touching these files, or even know of their
			existence. The exception to this is debugging Smarty template syntax errors,
			discussed later in this document.
			</para>
		</sect2>
		<sect2 id="section.caching">
        <title>Caching</title>
		<para>
            Smarty can cache the output of your generated templates. By default
            this is disabled. If you <link linkend="setting.caching">enable
            caching</link>, Smarty will store a copy of the generated template
            output, and use this until the copy <link
            linkend="setting.cache.lifetime">expires</link>, regenerating a new
            one. The default cache expire time can be configured from the
            class. The exception to the rule is the <link
            linkend="function.insert">insert</link> tag. Anything generated by
            the insert tag is not cached, but run dynamically on every
            invocation, even within cached content.
		</para>
        <para>
            TECHNICAL NOTE: Any time you change a template, change values in
            config files or change the content that gets displayed in a
            template, you must either clear the caches that are affected, or
            wait for the cache to expire to see the results of the changes. You
            can either do this manually by deleting files from the cache
            directory, or programatically with <link
            linkend="api.clear.cache">clear_cache</link> or <link
            linkend="api.clear.all.cache">clear_all_cache</link>.

		<title>Installing Smarty</title>
		<para>
        Installing Smarty is fairly straightforward, there is just one thing
        you must be aware of. Smarty creates PHP scripts from the templates.
        This usually means allowing user "nobody" (or whomever the web server
        runs as) to have permission to write the files. Each installation of a
        Smarty application minimally needs a templates directory and a compiled
        templates directory. If you use configuration files you will also need
        a directory for those. By default these are named "templates", and
        "templates_c" and "configs" respectively. If you plan on using caching,
        you will need to create a "cache" directory, also with permission to
        write files.
		</para>
        <para>
        TECHNICAL NOTE: You can get around the need to allow the web server
        user write access to compile templates. Smarty needs to compile the
        templates only once. This can be done from the command line, using the
        CGI version of PHP. example: "php -q index.php". Once the templates are
        compiled, they should run fine from the web environment. If you change
        a template, you must recompile from the command line again. If you do
        not have the CGI version of PHP available and you are concerned about
        world-writable directory access, you can chmod 777 the compile_dir, let
        the templates compile once as the web server user, then change the
        directory mode to 755. If you are using the caching feature of Smarty,
        the cache directory must always have write access for the web server
        user.
        </para>
        <para>
        TECHNICAL NOTE: If you do not have access to the php.ini file, you can
        change non-server settings (such as your include_path) with the
        ini_set() command (available in PHP 4.0.4 or later.) example:
        ini_set("include_path",".:/usr/local/lib/php");
        </para>
		<para>
		Copy the Smarty.class.php, Smarty.addons.php and Config_File.class.php
		scripts to a directory that is in your PHP include_path. NOTE: PHP will
		try to create a directory alongside the executing script called
		"templates_c". Be sure that directory permissions allow this to happen.
		You will see PHP error messages if this fails. You can also create the
		directory yourself before hand, and change the file ownership
		accordingly. See below.
		</para>
		<example>
			<title>Example of installing Smarty</title>
<programlisting>

# and you are in a un*x environment

chmod 700 templates_c
# if you are using caching, do the following

			<para>
                This is the name of the default template directory. If you do
                not supply a resource type when including files, they will be
                found here. By default this is "./templates", meaning that it
                will look for the templates directory in the same directory as
                the executing php script.
			</para>

                This is a list of variables that are always implicitly assigned
                to the template engine. This is handy for making global
                variables or server variables available to all templates
                without having to manually assign them. $SCRIPT_NAME is
                globally assigned by default.
			</para>
		</sect2>
		<sect2>
			<title>$compile_check</title>
			<para>
                Upon each invocation of the PHP application, Smarty tests to
                see if the current template has changed (later time stamp)
                since the last time it was compiled. If it has changed, it
                recompiles that template. By default this variable is set to
                true. Once an application is put into production and all
                templates are initially compiled, the compile_check step is no
                longer needed. Be sure to set $compile_check to "false" to
                improve performance! Note that if you change this to "false"
                and a template file is changed, you will *not* see the change
                since the template will not get recompiled. See <link
                linkend="setting.force.compile">$force_compile</link>
			</para>
		</sect2>
		<sect2 id="setting.force.compile">
			<title>$force_compile</title>
			<para>
				This forces Smarty to (re)compile each template on every
				invocation. This setting overrides $compile_check. By default
				this is disabled. This is handy for development and debugging.
				It should never be used in a production environment.
			</para>
		</sect2>
		<sect2 id="setting.caching">
			<title>$caching</title>
			<para>
                This tells Smarty whether or not to cache the output of the
                templates. By default this is set to false. If your templates
                generate the same content over and over, it is advisable to
                turn on caching. This will result significant performance
                gains. You can also have multiple caches for the same template.
                See <link linkend="api.is.cached">is_cached</link> for details.
                This was added to Smarty 1.3.0.

			For these examples, we will assume that you are using the default

			<para>
			Both built-in functions and custom functions have the same syntax
			in the templates. Built-in functions are the inner workings of
			Smarty, such as {if}, {section} and {strip}. They cannot be
			modified. Custom functions are located in the Smarty.addons.class
			file. They can be modified to your liking, or add new ones.

			<title>Attributes</title>
			<para>
			Attributes to functions are much like HTML attributes. Static
			values don't have to be enclosed in quotes, but it is recommended
			for literal strings. If not quoted, you may use a syntax that Smarty may confuse
			with another function, such as a boolean value. Variables may
			also be used, and should not be in quotes.

		<title>Config Files</title>
		<para>
        Config files are handy for designers to manage global template
        variables from one file. One example is template colors. Normally if
        you wanted to change the color scheme of an application, you would have
        to go through each and every template file and change the colors. With
        a config file, the colors can be kept in one place, and only one file
        needs to be updated. Note that to use config files, you must place the
        Config_File.class.php in your PHP include path. Config_File.class.php
        comes bundled with Smarty. Smarty will implicitly include the file if
        you don't already include it in your application.
		</para>
<example>
<title>Example of config file syntax</title>
<programlisting>

# global variables
pageTitle = "Main Menu"
bodyBgColor = #000000
tableBgColor = #000000
rowBgColor = #00ff00

[Customer]
pageTitle = "Customer Info"

[Login]
pageTitle = "Login"
focus = "username"
Intro = """This is a value that spans more
            than one line. you must enclose
			it in triple quotes."""
</programlisting>
</example>
			<para>
			Values of config file variables can be in quotes, but not necessary.
			You can use either single or double quotes. If you have a value that
			spans more than one line, enclose the entire value with triple quotes
			("""). You can put comments into config files by any syntax that is
			not a valid config file syntax. We recommend using a hashmark (#) at the
			beginning of the line.
			</para>
			<para>
			This config file example has two sections. Section names are enclosed
			in brackets []. The four variables at the top are global
			variables, or variables not within a section. These variables are
			always loaded from the config file.
			If a particular section is loaded, then the global variables and the
			variables from that section are loaded. If a variable exists both as
			a global and in a section, the section variable is used. If you name two
			variables the same within a section, the last one will be used.
			</para>

			<para>
			The insert tag in Smarty serves a special purpose. You may
			run into the situation where it is impossible to pass data to a template
			before the template is executed because there is info in the template
			needed to aquire the data, kind of a catch 22. The insert tag is a way
			to callback a function in PHP during runtime of the template.
			</para>
			<para>
			Let's say you have a template with a banner slot at the top of the page. The
			banner can contain any mixture of HTML, images, flash, etc. so we can't just
			use a static link here. In comes the insert tag: the template
			knows #banner_location_id# and #site_id# values (gathered from a config file),
			and needs to call a function to get the banner's contents.
			</para>
<example>
<title>function insert</title>
<programlisting>

{* example of fetching a banner *}
{insert name="getBanner" lid=#banner_location_id# sid=#site_id#}

</programlisting>
</example>
			<para>
			In this example, we are using the name "getBanner" and passing the
			parameters #banner_location_id# and #site_id#. Smarty will look
			for a function named insert_getBanner() in your PHP application, passing
			the values of #banner_location_id# and #site_id# as the first argument
			in an associative array. All insert function names in
			your application must be prepended with "insert_" to remedy possible
			function name-space conflicts. Your insert_getBanner() function should
			do something with the passed values and return the results. These results
			are then displayed in the template in place of the insert tag.
			In this example, Smarty would call this function:
			insert_getBanner(array("banner_id" => "12345","page_id" => "67890"));
			and display the returned results in place of the insert tag.
			</para>
			<para>
            TECHNICAL NOTE: It is possible to have portions of the template not
            cached. If you have <link linkend="section.caching">caching</link>
            turned on, insert tags will not be cached. They will run
            dynamically every time the page is created, even within cached
            pages. This works good for things like banners, polls, live
            weather, search results, user feedback areas, etc.
			</para>
		</sect2>
		<sect2>
			<title>if,elseif,else</title>
			<para>
			if statements in Smarty have much the same flexibility as php if
			statements, with a few added features for the template engine.
			Every <emphasis>if</emphasis> must be paired with an
			<emphasis>/if</emphasis>. <emphasis>else</emphasis> and
			<emphasis>elseif</emphasis> are also permitted. "eq", "ne","neq",
			"gt", "lt", "lte", "le", "gte" "ge","is even","is odd", "is not
			even","is not odd","not","mod","div by","even by","odd
			by","==","!=",">", "<","<=",">=" are all valid conditional
            qualifiers, and must be separated from surrounding elements by
            spaces.
			</para>

			<title>ldelim,rdelim</title>
			<para>
			ldelim and rdelim are used for displaying the literal delimiter, in

			delimiters, so this is the way around that.
			</para>
<example>
<title>ldelim, rdelim</title>

			<title>literal</title>
			<para>
			Literal tags allow a block of data to be taken literally,
			not being interpreted by the Smarty engine. This is handy
			for things like javascript sections, where there maybe
			curly braces and such things that would confuse the template

			<para>
            Template sections are used for looping over arrays of data. All
            <emphasis>section</emphasis> tags must be paired with
            <emphasis>/section</emphasis> tags. Required parameters are
            <emphasis>name</emphasis> and <emphasis>loop</emphasis>. The name
            of the section can be anything you like, made up of letters,
            numbers and underscores. Sections can be nested, and the nested
            section names must be unique from each other. The loop variable
            (usually an array of values) determines the number of times the
            section will loop. When printing a variable within a section, the
            section name must be given next to variable name within brackets
            []. If you are using an associative array, separate the key and
            value with a period (.). <emphasis>sectionelse</emphasis> is
            executed when there are no values in the loop variable.

			html_options is a custom function that creates html option
			lists with provided data. It takes care of which item is
			selected by default as well. Required attributes are values
            and output, unless you use options instead.
			</para>
<example>
<title>html_options</title>
<programlisting>

{* assume that $cust_ids, and $cust_names are arrays of values,
	and $customer_id may or may not be set to a value *}

&lt;select name=customer_id&gt;
	{html_options values=$cust_ids selected=$customer_id output=$cust_names}
&lt;/select&gt;


{* an alternative method is to pass the values & output as an associative array into
   options. $customer_options is an associative array in this example. This
   functionality was added to Smarty 1.3.0 *}

&lt;select name=customer_id&gt;
	{html_options options=$customer_options selected=$customer_id}
&lt;/select&gt;


OUTPUT:

&lt;select name=customer_id&gt;
	&lt;option value="1000">Joe Schmoe&lt;option&gt;
	&lt;option value="1001" selected>Jack Smith&lt;option&gt;

            math allows the template designer to do math equations in the
            template. Any numeric template variables may be used in the
            equations, and the result is printed in place of the tag. The
            variables used in the equation are passed as parameters, which can
            be template variables or static values. +, -, /, *, abs, ceil, cos,
            exp, floor, log, log10, max, min, pi, pow, rand, round, sin, sqrt,
            srans and tan are all valid operators. Check the PHP documenation
            for further information on these math functions.

			<title>Creating your own Custom Functions</title>
			<para>
			Creating your own functions is a fairly straight forward process.
			The best way is to look at the ones that come with Smarty as
			examples. The function names begin with smarty_func_ and they are
			located in the Smarty.addons.php file.
			</para>
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem><para>add your function to the Smarty.addons.php file.
						It is recommended that you prepend your function name
						with smarty_func_</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para>map a template function name to your PHP function.
							This is done at the top of the Smarty.class.php file
							in the $custom_funcs array.</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para>Thats it! you can now call that function
					from within Smarty.</para></listitem>
			</itemizedlist>			
			<para>
			All attributes passed to custom functions are passed into the
			first argument as an associative array. One way to get to those
			values is to call extract(func_get_arg(0)); at the top of your
			function. Anything that the function returns gets displayed
			in place of the tag in the template.
			</para>
			<para>
			Since version 1.4.0, custom functions are also passed Smarty object
			as the second parameter. If the custom function declares the second
			parameter passed by reference, it can then use Smarty object's
			variable assignment and clearing functions to manipulate template
			variables dynamically.
			</para>
            <para>
            You can also add custom functions programatically with the <link
            linkend="api.register.function">register_function API</link>.
            </para>
		</sect2>
	</sect1>
	<sect1 id="variable.modifiers">
		<title>Variable Modifiers</title>
		<para>
        Variable modifiers are a bit different than <link
        linkend="custom.functions">custom functions</link>. Variable modifiers
        alter variable contents before they are displayed to the template. All
        modifiers will get the value of the variable as the first argument, and
        must return a single value. Modifier parameters are separated by
        colons. Any additional parameters passed to a modifier are passed as-is
        positionally, much like calling a PHP function. You can also use native
        PHP functions as modifiers, but only if they expect the correct
        arguments. If they do not, you can always write a wrapper function in
        Smarty to get what you want. You can chain as many modifiers together
        on a variable as you like, separating each with a vertical pipe "|".
		</para>
		<para>
        NOTE: if you apply a modifier to an array instead of a single value
        variable, the modifier will be applied to every value in that array. If
        you really want the entire array passed to the modifier, you must
        prepend it with an "@" sign like so: {$articleTitle} (this will
        print out the number of elements in the $articleTitle array.)

            This formats a date and time into the given strftime() format.
            Dates can be passed to Smarty as unix timestamps, mysql timestamps
            or any string made up of month day year (parsable by strtotime).
            Designers can then use date_format to have complete control of the
            formatting of the date.

PROGRAMMERS NOTE: date_format is essentially a wrapper to PHP's strftime()
function. You may have more or less conversion specifiers available depending
on your system's strftime() function where PHP was compiled. Check your
system's manpage for a full list of valid specifiers.

            You can combine as many modifiers as you like on a single variable.
            This allows the ability to combine the application of different
            modifiers to a single variable. The modifiers will be applied to
            the variable in the order they are combined, from left to right.

           <para>
           Creating your own modifiers is a fairly straight forward process.
           The best way is to look at the ones that come with Smarty as
           examples. The function names begin with smarty_mod_ and they are
           located in the Smarty.addons.php file.

                       with smarty_mod_</para></listitem>
               <listitem><para>map a template modifier name to your PHP function.

       <title>Smarty/PHP errors</title>
       <para>
       Smarty can catch many errors such as missing tag attributes
       or malformed variable names. If this happens, you will see an error
       similar to the following:
       </para>

<example>
<title>Smarty errors</title>
<programlisting>

Warning: Smarty: [in index.tpl line 4]: syntax error: unknown tag - '%blah'
        in /path/to/smarty/Smarty.class.php on line 1041

Fatal error: Smarty: [in index.tpl line 28]: syntax error: missing section name
        in /path/to/smarty/Smarty.class.php on line 1041

</programlisting>
</example>

       <para>
        Smarty shows you the template name, the line number and the error.
        After that, the error consists of the actual line number in the Smarty
        class that the error occured.
       </para>
       
       <para>
        There are certain errors that Smarty cannot catch, such as missing
        close tags. These types of errors usually end up in PHP compile-time
        parsing errors.
       </para>

<example>
<title>PHP parsing errors</title>
<programlisting>

Parse error: parse error in /path/to/smarty/templates_c/index.tpl.php on line 75

</programlisting>
</example>
       
       <para>
        When you encounter a PHP parsing error, the error line number will
        correspond to the compiled PHP script, not the template itself. Usually
        you can look at the template and spot the syntax error. Here are some
        common things to look for: missing close tags for {if}{/if} or
        {section}{/section}, or syntax of logic within an {if} tag. If you
        can't find the error, you might have to open the compiled PHP file and
        go to the line number to figure out where the corresponding error is in
        the template.

       <title>Dates</title>
       <para>
       As a rule of thumb, always pass dates to Smarty as timestamps.
       This allows template designers to use <link
       linkend="date.format">date_format</link> for full control over date
       formatting, and also makes it easy to compare dates if necessary.
       </para>
<example>
<title>using date_format</title>

{$startDate|date_format}

OUTPUT:

{$startDate|date_format:"%Y/%m/%d"}

        When using {html_select_date} in a template, The programmer will most
        likely want to convert the output from the form back into timestamp
        format. Here is a function to help you with that.

	if(empty($month))
		$month = strftime("%m");
	if(empty($day))

		<title>WAP/WML</title>
		<para>
        WAP/WML templates require a php Content-Type header to be passed along
        with the template. The easist way to do this would be to write a custom
        function that prints the header. If you are using caching, that won't
        work so we'll do it using the insert tag (remember insert tags are not
        cached!) Be sure that there is nothing output to the browser before the
        template, or else the header may fail.
		</para>
<example>
<title>using insert to write a WML Content-Type header</title>
<programlisting>

// be sure apache is configure for the .wml extensions!                                    
// put this function somewhere in your application, or in Smarty.addons.php
function insert_header() {
    // this function expects $content argument
    extract(func_get_arg(0));
    if(empty($content))
        return;
    header($content);
    return;
}

// your Smarty template _must_ begin with the insert tag example:

{insert name=header content="Content-Type: text/vnd.wap.wml"}

&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;  
&lt;!DOCTYPE wml PUBLIC "-//WAPFORUM//DTD WML 1.1//EN" "http://www.wapforum.org/DTD/wml_1.1.xml"&gt;

&lt;do type="accept"&gt;

Press OK to continue...

&lt;/card&gt;  
&lt;!-- begin second card --&gt; 
&lt;card id="two"&gt;
