  <title>Overview</title>
  <para>
   It is undoubtedly one of the most asked questions on the PHP mailing
   lists: how do I make my PHP scripts independent of the layout? While
   PHP is billed as "HTML embedded scripting language", after writing a
   couple of projects that mixed PHP and HTML freely one comes up with the
   idea that separation of form and content is a Good Thing [TM]. In
   addition, in many companies the roles of layout designer and programmer
   are separate. Consequently, the search for a templating solution
   ensues.
  </para>
  <para>
   In our company for example, the development of an application goes on
   as follows: After the requirements docs are done, the interface
   designer makes mockups of the interface and gives them to the
   programmer. The programmer implements business logic in PHP and uses
   interface mockups to create skeleton templates. The project is then
   handed off to the HTML designer/web page layout person who brings the
   templates up to their full glory. The project may go back and forth
   between programming/HTML a couple of times. Thus, it's important to
   have good template support because programmers don't want anything to
   do with HTML and don't want HTML designers mucking around with PHP
   code. Designers need support for config files, dynamic blocks and
   other interface issues, but they don't want to have to deal with
   intricacies of the PHP programming language.
  </para>
  <para>
   Looking at many templating solutions available for PHP today, most of
   them provide a rudimentary way of substituting variables into templates
   and do a limited form of dynamic block functionality. But our needs
   required a bit more than that. We didn't want programmers to be dealing
   with HTML layout at ALL, but this was almost inevitable. For instance,
   if a designer wanted background colors to alternate on dynamic blocks,
   this had to be worked out with the programmer in advance. We also
   needed designers to be able to use their own configuration files, and
   pull variables from them into the templates. The list goes on.
  </para>
  <para>
   We started out writing out a spec for a template engine back in late
   1999.  After finishing the spec, we began to work on a template engine
   written in C that would hopefully be accepted for inclusion with PHP.
   Not only did we run into many complicated technical barriers, but there
   was also much heated debate about exactly what a template engine should
   and should not do. From this experience, we decided that the template
   engine should be written in PHP as a class, for anyone to use as they
   see fit. So we wrote an engine that did just that and
   <productname>SmartTemplate</productname> came into existence (note: this
   class was never submitted to the public). It was a class that did
   almost everything we wanted: regular variable substitution, supported
   including other templates, integration with config files, embedding PHP
   code, limited 'if' statement functionality and much more robust dynamic
   blocks which could be multiply nested. It did all this with regular
   expressions and the code turned out to be rather, shall we say,
   impenetrable. It was also noticably slow in large applications from all
   the parsing and regular expression work it had to do on each
   invocation. The biggest problem from a programmer's point of view was
   all the necessary work in the PHP script to setup and process templates
   and dynamic blocks. How do we make this easier?
  </para>
  <para>
   Then came the vision of what ultimately became Smarty. We know how fast
   PHP code is without the overhead of template parsing. We also know how
   meticulous and overbearing the PHP language may look to the average
   designer, and this could be masked with a much simpler templating
   syntax. So what if we combined the two strengths? Thus, Smarty was
   born...

   <title>What is Smarty?</title>
   <para>
    Smarty is a template engine for PHP. One of the unique aspects about
    Smarty is that it compiles the template files into native PHP scripts
    upon the first invocation. After that, it just executes the compiled
    PHP scripts. Therefore, there is no costly template file parsing for
    each request, and each template can take full advantage of PHP compiler
    cache solutions such as Zend Cache (http://www.zend.com) or APC
    (http://apc.communityconnect.com).

   <title>How Smarty works</title>

   <sect2 id="compiling"><title>Compiling</title>
    <para>
     Smarty compiles the templates into native PHP code on-the-fly. The actual
     PHP scripts that are generated are created implicitly, so theoretically you
     should never have to worry about touching these files, or even know of their
     existence. The exception to this is debugging Smarty template syntax errors,
     discussed later in this document.
    </para>
   </sect2>

   <sect2 id="section.caching">
    <title>Caching</title>
    <para>
     Smarty can cache the output of your generated templates. By default
     this is disabled. If you <link linkend="variable.caching">enable
      caching</link>, Smarty will store a copy of the generated template
     output, and use this until the copy <link
      linkend="variable.cache.lifetime">expires</link>, regenerating a new
     one. The default cache expire time can be configured from the
     class. The exception to the rule is the <link
      linkend="builtin.functions.insert">insert</link> tag. Anything
     generated by the insert tag is not cached, but run dynamically on
     every invocation, even within cached content.
    </para>
    <para>
     TECHNICAL NOTE: Any time you change a template, change values in
     config files or change the content that gets displayed in a
     template, you can turn on compile_check to regenerate the caches
     that are affected, or wait for the cache to expire to see the
     results of the changes. You clear caches manually by deleting files
     from the cache directory, programatically with <link
      linkend="api.clear.cache">clear_cache</link> or <link
      linkend="api.clear.all.cache">clear_all_cache</link>, or turn on
     $compile_check (or $force_compile).
    </para>
    <para>
     TECHNICAL NOTE: As of Smarty 1.4.6, if you have caching enabled AND
     you have compile_check enabled, the cached file will regenerate if
     an involved template or config file has been modified, regardless
     of the cache expire time. This results in a slight performance hit
     since it has to check the templates and config files for
     modification times. Therefore if you are not actively changing
     templates or config files, it is advisable to leave compile_check
     off. As of Smarty 1.4.7, enabling $force_compile will cause cache
     files to always be regenerated.

    <sect1 id="installation.requirements">
     <title>Requirements</title>
     <para>
      Smarty requires PHP 4.0.4pl1 or later. See the
      <link linkend="bugs">BUGS</link> section for caveats.

    <sect1 id="installation.smarty">
     <title>Installing Smarty</title>
     <para>
      Installing Smarty is fairly straightforward, there are a few things to
      be aware of. Smarty creates PHP scripts from the templates. This
      usually means allowing user "nobody" (or whomever the web server runs
      as) to have permission to write the files. Each installation of a
      Smarty application minimally needs a templates directory and a compiled
      templates directory. If you use configuration files you will also need
      a directory for those. By default these are named "templates",
      "templates_c" and "configs" respectively. If you plan on using caching,
      you will need to create a "cache" directory, also with permission to
      write files.
     </para>
     <para>
      TECHNICAL NOTE: You can get around the need to allow the web server
      user write access to compile templates. Smarty needs to compile the
      templates only once. This can be done from the command line, using the
      CGI version of PHP. example: "php -q index.php". Once the templates are
      compiled, they should run fine from the web environment. If you change
      a template, you must recompile from the command line again. If you do
      not have the CGI version of PHP available and you are concerned about
      world-writable directory access, you can chmod 777 the compile_dir, let
      the templates compile once as the web server user, then change the
      directory mode to 755. If you are using the caching feature of Smarty,
      the cache directory must always have write access for the web server
      user.
     </para>
     <para>
      TECHNICAL NOTE: If you do not have access to the php.ini file, you can
      change non-server settings (such as your include_path) with the
      ini_set() command (available in PHP 4.0.4 or later.) example:
      ini_set("include_path",".:/usr/local/lib/php");
     </para>
     <para>
      Copy the Smarty.class.php, Smarty.addons.php and Config_File.class.php
      scripts to a directory that is in your PHP include_path. NOTE: PHP will
      try to create a directory alongside the executing script called
      "templates_c". Be sure that directory permissions allow this to happen.
      You will see PHP error messages if this fails. You can also create the
      directory yourself before hand, and change the file ownership
      accordingly. See below.
     </para>
     <para>
      TECHNICAL NOTE: If you don't want to use include_path to find the
      Smarty files, you can set the SMARTY_DIR constant to the full path to
      your Smarty library files. Be sure the path ends with a slash!

      <para>
       This is the name of the default template directory. If you do
       not supply a resource type when including files, they will be
       found here. By default this is "./templates", meaning that it
       will look for the templates directory in the same directory as

      <para>
       This is the directory where Smarty will look for the plugins that
       it needs. The directory must be relative to the directory where
       Smarty itself is installed. Default is "plugins". There can be
       only one plugins directory.

     <sect1 id="variable.global.assign">
      <title>$global_assign</title>
      <para>
       This is a list of variables that are always implicitly assigned
       to the template engine. This is handy for making global
       variables or server variables available to all templates
       without having to manually assign them. Each element in the
       $global_assign should be either a name of the global variable,
       or a key/value pair, where the key is the name of the global
       array and the value is the array of variables to be assigned
       from that global array. $SCRIPT_NAME is globally assigned by
       default from $HTTP_SERVER_VARS.
      </para>
      <para>
       TECHNICAL NOTE: Server variables can be accessed through the
       $smarty variable, such as {$smarty.server.SCRIPT_NAME}. See the
       section on the
       <link linkend="builtin.variable.smarty">$smarty</link> variable.

     <sect1 id="variable.undefined">
      <title>$undefined</title>
      <para>
       This sets the value of $undefined for Smarty, default is null.
       Currently this is only used to set undefined variables in
       $global_assign to a default value.
      </para>
     </sect1>
     <sect1>
      <title>$compile_check</title>
      <para>
       Upon each invocation of the PHP application, Smarty tests to
       see if the current template has changed (later time stamp)
       since the last time it was compiled. If it has changed, it
       recompiles that template. As of 1.4.0, if the template has not
       been compiled, it will compile regardless of this setting. By
       default this variable is set to true. Once an application is
       put into production (templates won't be changing), the
       compile_check step is no longer needed. Be sure to set
       $compile_check to "false" to improve performance! Note that if
       you change this to "false" and a template file is changed, you
       will *not* see the change since the template will not get
       recompiled. If caching is enabled and compile_check is enabled,
       then the cache files will get regenerated if an involved
       template file was updated. See <link
        linkend="variable.force.compile">$force_compile</link> or <link
        linkend="api.clear.compiled.tpl">clear_compiled_tpl</link>.
      </para>
     </sect1>
     <sect1 id="variable.force.compile">
      <title>$force_compile</title>
      <para>
       This forces Smarty to (re)compile templates on every
       invocation. This setting overrides $compile_check. By default
       this is disabled. This is handy for development and debugging.
       It should never be used in a production environment. If caching
       is enabled, the cache file(s) will be regenerated every time.
      </para>
     </sect1>
     <sect1 id="variable.caching">
      <title>$caching</title>
      <para>
       This tells Smarty whether or not to cache the output of the
       templates. By default this is set to false. If your templates
       generate redundant redundant content over and over again and
       again repeatedly, it is advisable to turn on caching. This will
       result in significant performance gains. You can also have
       multiple caches for the same template. See <link
        linkend="api.is.cached">is_cached</link> for details. This was
       added to Smarty 1.3.0.
      </para>
      <para>
       If $compile_check is enabled, the cached content will be
       regenerated if any of the involved templates are changed. (new
       to 1.4.6). If $force_compile is enabled, the cached content
       will always be regenerated. (added to Smarty 1.4.7)
      </para>
     </sect1>
     <sect1 id="variable.cache.dir">
      <title>$cache_dir</title>
      <para>
       This is the name of the directory where template caches are
       stored. By default this is "./cache", meaning that it will look
       for the cache directory in the same directory as the executing
       php script. You can also use your own custom cache handler
       function to control cache files, which will ignore this
       setting. (added to Smarty 1.3.0)
      </para>
      <para>
       TECHNICAL NOTE: This setting must be either a relative or
       absolute path. include_path is not used for writing files.

     <sect1 id="variable.cache.lifetime">
      <title>$cache_lifetime</title>
      <para>
       This is the length of time in seconds that a template cache is
       valid. Once this time has expired, the cache will be
       regenerated. $caching must be set to "true" for this setting to
       work. You can also force the cache to expire with <link
        linkend="api.clear.all.cache">clear_all_cache</link>. (added to

     <sect1 id="variable.cache.handler.func">
      <title>$cache_handler_func</title>
      <para>
       You can supply a custom function to handle cache files instead
       of using the built-in method using the $cache_dir. See the
       custom cache handler function section for details.

     <sect1 id="variable.cache.modified.check">
      <title>$cache_modified_check</title>
      <para>
       If set to true, Smarty will respect the If-Modified-Since
       header sent from the client. If the cached file timestamp has
       not changed since the last visit, then a "304 Not Modified"
       header will be sent instead of the content. This works only on
       cached content without <command>{insert}</command> tags.

      <para>
       This tells Smarty how to handle PHP code embedded in the

       SMARTY_PHP_PASSTHRU. Note that this does NOT affect php code
       within <link linkend="builtin.functions.php">{php}{/php}</link>
       tags in the template.

	<title>Smarty Templates</title>
	<para>
	The templates are the heart of Smarty. These are the files that the designers
	work with. They're basically pages made up of static content interspersed with
	template markup tags. These tags are placeholders for variables or blocks of logic.
	</para>
	<sect1>
		<title>Syntax</title>
		<para>
			For these examples, we will assume that you are using the default
			template tag delimiters, which are "{" and "}". In Smarty, all content
			outside of delimiter tags is displayed as static content, or unchanged.
			When Smarty encounters template tags {}, it attempts to interpret what is
			between the tags, and displays the appropriate output in place of them.
		</para>
		<sect2>
			<title>Variables assigned from PHP</title>
			<para>
			Variables that are assigned from PHP are referenced by preceding
			them with a dollar sign ($) and enclosing the variable in delimiters
			like so: $varname

			<para>
			Both built-in functions and custom functions have the same syntax
			in the templates. Built-in functions are the inner workings of
			Smarty, such as {if}, {section} and {strip}. They cannot be
			modified. Custom functions are located in the Smarty.addons.class
			file. They can be modified to your liking, or add new ones.
			{html_options} and {html_select_date} are examples of custom

		<sect2>
			<title>Attributes</title>
			<para>
			Attributes to functions are much like HTML attributes. Static
			values don't have to be enclosed in quotes, but it is recommended
			for literal strings. If not quoted, you may use a syntax that Smarty may confuse
			with another function, such as a boolean value. Variables may
			also be used, and should not be in quotes.

		<title>Config Files</title>
		<para>
        Config files are handy for designers to manage global template
        variables from one file. One example is template colors. Normally if
        you wanted to change the color scheme of an application, you would have
        to go through each and every template file and change the colors. With
        a config file, the colors can be kept in one place, and only one file
        needs to be updated. Note that to use config files, you must place the
        Config_File.class.php in your PHP include path. Config_File.class.php
        comes bundled with Smarty. Smarty will implicitly include the file if
        you don't already include it in your application.
		</para>
<example>
<title>Example of config file syntax</title>
<programlisting>
# global variables
pageTitle = "Main Menu"
bodyBgColor = #000000
tableBgColor = #000000
rowBgColor = #00ff00

[Customer]
pageTitle = "Customer Info"

[Login]
pageTitle = "Login"
focus = "username"
Intro = """This is a value that spans more
            than one line. you must enclose
			it in triple quotes."""

# hidden section
[.Database]
host=my.domain.com
db=ADDRESSBOOK
user=php-user
pass=foobar
</programlisting>
</example>
			<para>
			Values of config file variables can be in quotes, but not necessary.
			You can use either single or double quotes. If you have a value that
			spans more than one line, enclose the entire value with triple quotes
			("""). You can put comments into config files by any syntax that is
			not a valid config file syntax. We recommend using a hashmark (#) at the
			beginning of the line.
			</para>
			<para>
			This config file example has two sections. Section names are enclosed
			in brackets []. The four variables at the top are global
			variables, or variables not within a section. These variables are
			always loaded from the config file.
			If a particular section is loaded, then the global variables and the
			variables from that section are loaded. If a variable exists both as
			a global and in a section, the section variable is used. If you name two
			variables the same within a section, the last one will be used.
			</para>
			<para>
			Config files are loaded into templates with the built-in function
			called <link linkend="builtin.functions.configload">config_load</link>.
			</para>
			<para>
			You can hide variables or entire sections by prepending the variable
			name or section name with a period. This is useful if your
			application reads the config files and gets sensitive data from them
			that the template engine does not need. If you have third parties
			doing template editing, you can be certain that they cannot read
			sensitive data from the config file by loading it into the template.
			This is new in Smarty 1.4.6.

    <sect1 id="builtin.functions">
     <title>Built-in Functions</title>
     <para>
      Smarty comes with several built-in functions. Built-in functions
      are integral to the template language. You cannot create custom
      functions with the same names, nor can you modify built-in functions.
     </para>
     <sect2 id="builtin.functions.capture">
      <title>capture</title>
      <para>
       capture is used to collect the output of the template into a
       variable instead of displaying it. Any content between {capture
       name="foo"} and {/capture} is collected into the variable specified
       in the name attribute. The captured content can be used in the
       template from the special variable $smarty.capture.foo where foo is
       the value passed in the name attribute. If you do not supply a name
       attribute, then "default" will be used. All {capture} commands must
       be paired with {/capture}. You can nest capture commands. capture
       was added to Smarty 1.4.0. The "name" attribute was added to Smarty
       1.4.5.
      </para>
      <para>
       NOTE: Smarty 1.4.0 - 1.4.4 placed the captured content into the
       variable named $return. As of 1.4.5, this behavior was changed to use
       the name attribute, so update your templates accordingly.
      </para>
      <caution>
       <para>
        Be careful when capturing <command>{insert}</command> output. If
        you have caching turned on and you have <command>{insert}</command>
        commands that you expect to run within cached content, do not
        capture this content.

			<para>
			Insert tags work much like include tags, except that insert tags
			are not cached when you have template <link
			linkend="section.caching">caching</link> enabled. They will be
			executed on every invocation of the template.
			</para>
            <para>
             Let's say you have a template with a banner slot at the top of
             the page. The banner can contain any mixture of HTML, images,
             flash, etc. so we can't just use a static link here, and we
             don't want this contents cached with the page. In comes the
             insert tag: the template knows #banner_location_id# and
             #site_id# values (gathered from a config file), and needs to
             call a function to get the banner contents.
			</para>
<example>
<title>function insert</title>
<programlisting>
{* example of fetching a banner *}
{insert name="getBanner" lid=#banner_location_id# sid=#site_id#}</programlisting>
</example>
			<para>
			In this example, we are using the name "getBanner" and passing the
			parameters #banner_location_id# and #site_id#. Smarty will look
			for a function named insert_getBanner() in your PHP application, passing
			the values of #banner_location_id# and #site_id# as the first argument
			in an associative array. All insert function names in
			your application must be prepended with "insert_" to remedy possible
			function name-space conflicts. Your insert_getBanner() function should
			do something with the passed values and return the results. These results
			are then displayed in the template in place of the insert tag.
			In this example, Smarty would call this function:
			insert_getBanner(array("lid" => "12345","sid" => "67890"));
			and display the returned results in place of the insert tag.
			</para>
			<para>
			If you supply the "assign" attribute, the output of the insert tag
			will be assigned to this template variable instead of being output
			to the template. NOTE: assiging the output to a template variable
			isn't too useful with caching enabled. (added to Smarty 1.5.0)
			</para>
			<para>
			If you supply the "script" attribute, this php script will be
			included (only once) before the insert function is executed. This
			is the case where the insert function may not exist yet, and a php
			script must be included first to make it work. The path can be
			either absolute, or relative to $trusted_dir. When security is
			enabled, the script must reside in $trusted_dir. (added to Smarty
			1.5.2)
			</para>
			<para>
			The Smarty object is passed as the second argument. This way you
			can reference and modify information in the Smarty object from
			within the insert function. (added in 1.4.5)
			</para>
			<para>
            TECHNICAL NOTE: It is possible to have portions of the template not
            cached. If you have <link linkend="section.caching">caching</link>
            turned on, insert tags will not be cached. They will run
            dynamically every time the page is created, even within cached
            pages. This works good for things like banners, polls, live
            weather, search results, user feedback areas, etc.
			</para>

		<sect2>
			<title>if,elseif,else</title>
			<para>
			if statements in Smarty have much the same flexibility as php if
			statements, with a few added features for the template engine.
			Every <emphasis>if</emphasis> must be paired with an
			<emphasis>/if</emphasis>. <emphasis>else</emphasis> and
			<emphasis>elseif</emphasis> are also permitted. "eq", "ne","neq",
			"gt", "lt", "lte", "le", "gte" "ge","is even","is odd", "is not
			even","is not odd","not","mod","div by","even by","odd
			by","==","!=",">", "<","<=",">=" are all valid conditional
            qualifiers, and must be separated from surrounding elements by
            spaces.

			<title>ldelim,rdelim</title>
			<para>
			ldelim and rdelim are used for displaying the literal delimiter, in

			<para>
            Template sections are used for looping over arrays of data. All
            <emphasis>section</emphasis> tags must be paired with
            <emphasis>/section</emphasis> tags. Required parameters are
            <emphasis>name</emphasis> and <emphasis>loop</emphasis>. The name
            of the section can be anything you like, made up of letters,
            numbers and underscores. Sections can be nested, and the nested
            section names must be unique from each other. The loop variable
            (usually an array of values) determines the number of times the
            section will loop. When printing a variable within a section, the
            section name must be given next to variable name within brackets
            []. <emphasis>sectionelse</emphasis> is
            executed when there are no values in the loop variable.

			<para>
			<emphasis>foreach</emphasis> loops are an alternative to
			<emphasis>section</emphasis> loops. <emphasis>foreach</emphasis> is
			used to loop over a single associative array. The syntax for
			<emphasis>foreach</emphasis> is much easier than
			<emphasis>section</emphasis>, but as a tradeoff it can only be used
			for a single array. <emphasis>foreach</emphasis> tags must be
			paired with <emphasis>/foreach</emphasis> tags. Required parameters
			are <emphasis>from</emphasis> and <emphasis>item</emphasis>. The
			name of the foreach loop can be anything you like, made up of
			letters, numbers and underscores. <emphasis>foreach</emphasis>
			loops can be nested, and the nested foreach names must be unique
			from each other. The <emphasis>from</emphasis> variable (usually an
			array of values) determines the number of times
			<emphasis>foreach</emphasis> will loop.
			<emphasis>foreachelse</emphasis> is executed when there are no
			values in the <emphasis>from</emphasis> variable.

			<title>strip</title>
			<para>
			Many times web designers
			run into the issue where white space and carriage returns
			affect the output of the rendered HTML (browser "features"), so you
			must run all your tags together in the template to get the
			desired results. This usually ends up in unreadable or
			unmanagable templates.
			</para>
			<para>
			Anything within {strip}{/strip} tags in Smarty are stripped of
			the extra spaces or carriage returns at the beginnings and
			ends of the lines before they are displayed.
			This way you can keep your templates readable, and not worry
			about extra white space causing problems.

			html_options is a custom function that creates html option
			lists with provided data. It takes care of which item is
			selected by default as well. Required attributes are values
            and output, unless you use options instead.
			</para>
			<para>
			NOTE: As of Smarty 1.4.5, html_options now outputs xhtml compatible
			code.

&lt;/select&gt;


{* an alternative method is to pass the values & output as an associative array into
   options. $customer_options is an associative array in this example. This
   functionality was added to Smarty 1.3.0 *}

            math allows the template designer to do math equations in the
            template. Any numeric template variables may be used in the
            equations, and the result is printed in place of the tag. The
            variables used in the equation are passed as parameters, which can
            be template variables or static values. +, -, /, *, abs, ceil, cos,
            exp, floor, log, log10, max, min, pi, pow, rand, round, sin, sqrt,
            srans and tan are all valid operators. Check the PHP documenation
            for further information on these math functions.
			</para>
			<para>
			If you supply the special "assign" attribute, the output of the
			math function will be assigned to this template variable instead of
			being output to the template.

		<title>Variable Modifiers</title>
		<para>
        Variable modifiers are a bit different than <link
        linkend="custom.functions">custom functions</link>. Variable modifiers
        alter variable contents before they are displayed to the template. All
        modifiers will get the value of the variable as the first argument, and
        must return a single value. Modifier parameters are separated by
        colons. Any additional parameters passed to a modifier are passed as-is
        positionally, much like calling a PHP function. You can also use native
        PHP functions as modifiers, but only if they expect the correct
        arguments. If they do not, you can always write a wrapper function in
        Smarty to get what you want. You can chain as many modifiers together
        on a variable as you like, separating each with a vertical pipe "|".
		</para>
		<para>
        NOTE: if you apply a modifier to an array instead of a single value
        variable, the modifier will be applied to every value in that array. If
        you really want the entire array passed to the modifier, you must
        prepend it with an "@" sign like so: {$articleTitle|@count} (this will
        print out the number of elements in the $articleTitle array.)

PROGRAMMERS NOTE: date_format is essentially a wrapper to PHP's strftime()
function. You may have more or less conversion specifiers available depending
on your system's strftime() function where PHP was compiled. Check your
system's manpage for a full list of valid specifiers.</programlisting>

			<title>Combining Modifiers</title>

            You can combine as many modifiers as you like on a single variable.
            This allows the ability to combine the application of different
            modifiers to a single variable. The modifiers will be applied to
            the variable in the order they are combined, from left to right.

<chapter id="plugins">
   <title>Plugins</title>
   <para>
    Version 2.0 introduced the plugin architecture that is used
    for almost all the customizable functionality of Smarty. This includes:
    <itemizedlist spacing=compact>
     <listitem><simpara>functions</simpara></listitem>
     <listitem><simpara>modifiers</simpara></listitem>
     <listitem><simpara>compiler functions</simpara></listitem>
     <listitem><simpara>prefilters</simpara></listitem>
     <listitem><simpara>postfilters</simpara></listitem>
     <listitem><simpara>resources</simpara></listitem>
     <listitem><simpara>inserts</simpara></listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    With the exception of resources, backwards compatibility with the old
    way of registering handler functions via register_* API is preserved. If
    you did not use the API but instead modified the class variables
    <literal>$custom_funcs</literal>, <literal>$custom_mods</literal>, and
    other ones directly, then you will need to adjust your scripts to either
    use the API or convert your custom functionality into plugins.
   </para>
   
   <sect1>
    <title>How Plugins Work</title>
    <para>
     Plugins are always loaded on demand. Only the specific modifiers,
     functions, resources, etc invoked in the templates or PHP scripts will
     be loaded. Moreover, each plugin is loaded only once, even if you have
     several different instances of Smarty running within the same request.
    </para>
    <para>
     Pre/post-filters are a bit of a special case. If a pre/post-filter
     plugin is found in the plugins directory, it will always be loaded
     because these filters are never explicitly mentioned in the template
     language. This also means that the order in which multiple prefilters
     or postfilters is executed depends on the way they are named
     (basically, alphabetical order).
    </para>
    <para>
     There is only one plugins directory (for performance reasons). To
     install a plugin, simply place it in the directory and Smarty will use
     it automatically.
    </para>
   </sect1>

   <sect1 id="plugins.naming.conventions">
    <title>Naming Conventions</title>
    <para>
     Plugin files and functions must follow a very specific naming
     convention in order to be located by Smarty.
    </para>
    <para>
     The plugin files must be named as follows:
     <blockquote>
      <para>
       <filename>
        <replaceable>type</replaceable>.<replaceable>name</replaceable>.php
       </filename>
      </para>
     </blockquote>
    </para>
    <para>
     Where <literal>type</literal> is one of these plugin types:
     <itemizedlist spacing=compact>
      <listitem><simpara>function</simpara></listitem>
      <listitem><simpara>modifier</simpara></listitem>
      <listitem><simpara>compiler</simpara></listitem>
      <listitem><simpara>prefilter</simpara></listitem>
      <listitem><simpara>postfilter</simpara></listitem>
      <listitem><simpara>resource</simpara></listitem>
      <listitem><simpara>insert</simpara></listitem>
     </itemizedlist>
    </para>
    <para>
     And <literal>name</literal> should be a valid identifier (letters,
     numbers, and underscores only).
    </para>
    <para>
     Some examples: <literal>function.html_select_date.php</literal>,
     <literal>resource.db.php</literal>,
     <literal>modifier.spacify.php</literal>.
    </para>
    <para>
     The plugin functions inside the plugin files must be named as follows:
     <blockquote>
      <para>
       <function>smarty_<replaceable>type</replaceable>_<replaceable>name</replaceable></function>
      </para>
     </blockquote>
    </para>
    <para>
     The meanings of <literal>type</literal> and <literal>name</literal> are
     the same as before.
    </para>
    <para>
     Smarty will output appropriate error messages if the plugin file it
     needs is not found, or if the file or the plugin function are named
     improperly.
    </para>
    <note>
     <para>
      Note that pre/postfilters still have to be correctly named even though
      the names are not used for anything except their order of execution.
     </para>
    </note>
   </sect1>

   <sect1 id="plugins.writing">
    <title>Writing Plugins</title>
    <para>
     Plugins can be either loaded by Smarty automatically from the
     filesystem or they can be registered at runtime via one of the
     register_* API functions. They can also be unregistered by using
     unregister_* API functions.
    </para>
    <para>
     For the plugins that are registered at runtime, the name of the plugin
     function(s) does not have to follow the naming convention.
    </para>
    <para>
     If a plugin depends on some functionality provided by another plugin
     (as is the case with some plugins bundled with Smarty), then the proper
     way to load the needed plugin is this:
    </para>
    <programlisting>
require_once SMARTY_DIR . 'plugins/function.html_options.php';</programlisting>
    <para>
     As a general rule, Smarty object is always passed to the plugins as the last
     parameter (except for modifiers).

    <para>
     All attributes passed to template functions from the template are
     contained in the <parameter>$params</parameter> as an associative
     array. Either access those values directly, e.g.
     <varname>$params['start']</varname> or use
     <varname>extract($params)</varname> to import them into the symbol
     table.
    </para>
    <para>
     The output of the function will be substituted in place of the
     function tag in the template (<function>fetch</function> function, for
     example). Alternatively, the function can simply perform some other
     task without any output (<function>assign</function> function).
    </para>
    <para>
     If the function needs to assign some variables to the template or use
     some other Smarty-provided functionality, it can use the supplied
     <parameter>$smarty</parameter> object to do so.

    <para>
     The second function is supposed to retrieve the last modification time
     of the requested resource (as a UNIX timestamp). The second parameter
     is a variable passed by reference where the timestamp should be stored.
     The function is supposed to return <literal>true</literal> if the
     timestamp could be succesfully determined, and <literal>false</literal>
     otherwise.

     The third function is supposed to return <literal>true</literal> or

     is secure or not. This function is used only for template resources but

     The fourth function is supposed to return <literal>true</literal> or

   <title>Debugging Console</title>

   There is a dubugging console included with Smarty. The console informs you
   of all the included templates, assigned variables and config file variables
   for the current invocation of the template. A template named "debug.tpl" is
   included with the distribution of Smarty which controls the formatting of
   the console. Set $debugging to true in Smarty, and if needed set $debug_tpl
   to the template resource path for debug.tpl (this is in $template_dir by
   default.) When you load the page, a javascript console window should pop up
   and give you the names of all the included templates and assigned variables
   for the current page. To disable the debugging console, set $debugging to
   false. You can also temporarily turn on the debugging console by putting
   SMARTY_DEBUG in the URL if you enable this option with <link
   linkend="variable.debugging.ctrl">$debugging_ctrl</link>.
   </para>

   TECHNICAL NOTE: The debugging console does not work when you use the fetch()
   API, only when using display(). It is a set of javascript statements added
   to the very bottom of the generated template. If you do not like javascript,
   you can edit the debug.tpl template to format the output however you like.
   Debug data is not cached and debug.tpl info is not included in the output of

       <title>Smarty/PHP errors</title>
       <para>
       Smarty can catch many errors such as missing tag attributes
       or malformed variable names. If this happens, you will see an error
       similar to the following:
       </para>

<example>
<title>Smarty errors</title>
<programlisting>
Warning: Smarty: [in index.tpl line 4]: syntax error: unknown tag - '%blah'
        in /path/to/smarty/Smarty.class.php on line 1041

Fatal error: Smarty: [in index.tpl line 28]: syntax error: missing section name
        in /path/to/smarty/Smarty.class.php on line 1041</programlisting>
</example>

       <para>
        Smarty shows you the template name, the line number and the error.
        After that, the error consists of the actual line number in the Smarty
        class that the error occured.
       </para>
       
       <para>
        There are certain errors that Smarty cannot catch, such as missing
        close tags. These types of errors usually end up in PHP compile-time
        parsing errors.
       </para>

<example>
<title>PHP parsing errors</title>
<programlisting>
Parse error: parse error in /path/to/smarty/templates_c/index.tpl.php on line 75</programlisting>
</example>
       
       <para>
        When you encounter a PHP parsing error, the error line number will
        correspond to the compiled PHP script, not the template itself. Usually
        you can look at the template and spot the syntax error. Here are some
        common things to look for: missing close tags for {if}{/if} or
        {section}{/section}, or syntax of logic within an {if} tag. If you
        can't find the error, you might have to open the compiled PHP file and
        go to the line number to figure out where the corresponding error is in
        the template.

		If a variable is used frequently throughout your templates, applying
		the default modifier every time it is mentioned can get a bit ugly. You
		can remedy this by assigning the variable its default value with the
		<link linkend="custom.functions.assign">assign</link> function.
		</para>
<example>
<title>Assigning a template variable its default value</title>
<programlisting>
{* do this somewhere at the top of your template *}
{assign var="title" value=$title|default:"no title"}

{* if $title was empty, it now contains the value "no title" when you print it *}
{$title}</programlisting>
</example>

		<title>Passing variable title to header template</title>
		<para>
		When the majority of your templates use the same headers and footers, it
		is common to split those out into their own templates and include them.
		But what if the header needs to have a different title, depending on
		what page you are coming from? You can pass the title to the header when
		it is included.
		</para>
<example>
<title>Passing the title variable to the header template</title>
<programlisting>

mainpage.tpl
------------

{include file="header.tpl" title="Main Page"}
{* template body goes here *}
{include file="footer.tpl"}


archives.tpl
------------

{config_load file="archive_page.conf"}
{include file="header.tpl" title=#archivePageTitle#}
{* template body goes here *}
{include file="footer.tpl"}


header.tpl
----------
&lt;HTML&gt;
&lt;HEAD&gt;
&lt;TITLE&gt;{$title|default:"BC News"}&lt;/TITLE&gt;
&lt;/HEAD&gt;
&lt;BODY&gt;


footer.tpl
----------
&lt;/BODY&gt;
&lt;/HTML&gt;</programlisting>
</example>
	<para>
		When the main page is drawn, the title of "Main Page" is passed to the
		header.tpl, and will subsequently be used as the title. When the
		archives page is drawn, the title will be "Archives". Notice in the
		archive example, we are using a variable from the archives_page.conf
		file instead of a hard coded variable. Also notice that "BC News" is
		printed if the $title variable is not set, using the
		<emphasis>default</emphasis> variable modifier.

       <title>Dates</title>
       <para>
       As a rule of thumb, always pass dates to Smarty as timestamps.
       This allows template designers to use <link
       linkend="date.format">date_format</link> for full control over date
       formatting, and also makes it easy to compare dates if necessary.
       </para>
       <para>
       NOTE: As of Smarty 1.4.0, you can pass dates to Smarty as unix
       timestamps, mysql timestamps, or any date parsable by strtotime().
       </para>
<example>
<title>using date_format</title>
<programlisting>
{$startDate|date_format}

OUTPUT:

Jan 4, 2001


{$startDate|date_format:"%Y/%m/%d"}

OUTPUT:

2001/01/04


{if $date1 < $date2}
	...
{/if}</programlisting>
</example>
		<para>
        When using {html_select_date} in a template, The programmer will most
        likely want to convert the output from the form back into timestamp
        format. Here is a function to help you with that.
		</para>
<example>
<title>converting form date elements back to a timestamp</title>
<programlisting>
// this assumes your form elements are named
// startDate_Day, startDate_Month, startDate_Year

$startDate = makeTimeStamp($startDate_Year,$startDate_Month,$startDate_Day);

function makeTimeStamp($year="",$month="",$day="")
{
	if(empty($year))
		$year = strftime("%Y");
	if(empty($month))
		$month = strftime("%m");
	if(empty($day))
		$day = strftime("%d");

	return mktime(0,0,0,$month,$day,$year);
}</programlisting>

		<title>WAP/WML</title>
		<para>
        WAP/WML templates require a php Content-Type header to be passed along
        with the template. The easist way to do this would be to write a custom
        function that prints the header. If you are using caching, that won't
        work so we'll do it using the insert tag (remember insert tags are not
        cached!) Be sure that there is nothing output to the browser before the
        template, or else the header may fail.
		</para>
<example>
<title>using insert to write a WML Content-Type header</title>
<programlisting>
// be sure apache is configure for the .wml extensions!                                    
// put this function somewhere in your application, or in Smarty.addons.php
function insert_header() {
    // this function expects $content argument
    extract(func_get_arg(0));
    if(empty($content))
        return;
    header($content);
    return;
}

// your Smarty template _must_ begin with the insert tag example:

{insert name=header content="Content-Type: text/vnd.wap.wml"}

&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;  
&lt;!DOCTYPE wml PUBLIC "-//WAPFORUM//DTD WML 1.1//EN" "http://www.wapforum.org/DTD/wml_1.1.xml"&gt; 

&lt;!-- begin new wml deck --&gt; 
&lt;wml&gt; 
&lt;!-- begin first card --&gt; 
&lt;card&gt; 
&lt;do type="accept"&gt; 
&lt;go href="#two"/&gt; 
&lt;/do&gt;  
&lt;p&gt; 
Welcome to WAP with Smarty!
Press OK to continue...  
&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/card&gt;  
&lt;!-- begin second card --&gt; 
&lt;card id="two"&gt;  
&lt;p&gt; 
Pretty easy isn't it?
&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/card&gt;

        Traditionally, programming templates into your applications goes as
        follows: First, you accumulate your variables within your PHP
        application, (maybe with database queries.) Then, you instantiate your
        Smarty object, assign the variables and display the template. So lets
        say for example we have a stock ticker on our template. We would
        collect the stock data in our application, then assign these variables
        in the template and display it. Now wouldn't it be nice if you could
        add this stock ticker to any application by merely including the
        template, and not worry about fetching the data up front?
		</para>
        <para>
        You can embed PHP into your templates with the {php}{/php} tags.
        With this, you can setup self contained templates with their own
        data structures for assigning their own variables. With the logic
        embedded like this, you can keep the template & logic together. This
        way no matter where the template source is coming from, it is always
        together as one component.
        </para>
<example>
<title>componentized template</title>
<programlisting>
{* Smarty *}

{php}

	// setup our function for fetching stock data
	function fetch_ticker($symbol,&$ticker_name,&$ticker_price) {
		// put logic here that fetches $ticker_name
		// and $ticker_price from some resource
	}

	// call the function
	fetch_ticker("YHOO",$ticker_name,$ticker_price);
	
	// assign template variables
    $this->assign("ticker_name",$ticker_name);
    $this->assign("ticker_price",$ticker_price);

{/php}

Stock Name: {$ticker_name} Stock Price: {$ticker_price}</programlisting>
</example>
        <para>
		As of Smarty 1.5.0, there is even a cleaner way. You can include php in
		your templates with the {include_php ...} tag. This way you can keep
		your PHP logic separated from the template logic. See the <link
		linkend="builtin.functions.include.php">include_php</link> function for
		more information.
        </para>
<example>
<title>componentized template with include_php</title>
<programlisting>
load_ticker.php

&lt;?php
	// setup our function for fetching stock data
	function fetch_ticker($symbol,&$ticker_name,&$ticker_price) {

		// and $ticker_price from some resource
	}

	// call the function
	fetch_ticker("YHOO",$ticker_name,$ticker_price);
	
	// assign template variables
    $this->assign("ticker_name",$ticker_name);
    $this->assign("ticker_price",$ticker_price);
